# Ecosystem on Windows

Sadly, on Windows, there are no default directories/folders for use with things like:
- Log files
- Lock files
- Unix Domain Socket files

There is simply no sane mechanism that I have been able to find, that would allow for a
platform independent means, of setting defaults for these kinds of things.

Therefore, on Windows, all these file locations have to be explicitly set through one of the configuration strategies employed in Ecosystem.

Also note that: All example code for Ecosystem, is written with Linux as the target platform.

Not because I have anything against Windows, it's just that Linux is what I have.

Yes, I do not have a Windows machine. I have not had one since 1999.

No, I have never owned a MAC.
