**Important**:

Everything I've done here should work on a modern day Linux machine.

Yes. Linux.

I've not used Windows in over a decade and I can not bring myself to the point where I can justify spending the money for a MAC.

I can feed a family for 6 months with the cost of one MAC computer so ... No, just ... No.

So, keep that in mind when you are looking at the examples. They might not work as is for your environment. Especially when it comes to directories/folders used.
